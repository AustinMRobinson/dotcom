## Context

- System started as vanilla HTML only, then expanded to React, React Native and Angular
- The original website was built solely with vanilla HTML using Handlebars, did not provide code snippets
- Very difficult to update content, so the content was stale
- Used Storybook for all React code snippets/demos
- Difficult to get reproductions or share demos (playground)
- Documentation was only relevant for the most recent version - leaving many consumers out to dry
- Wanted something scalable into the future and easy to update
- Content discoverability issue: lack of search, no prioitized IA, long side nav
