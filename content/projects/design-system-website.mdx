## Context

The Tesla Design System was originally built as vanilla HTML only, used as a component library for Tesla.com. From there, it then expanded to React for applications adjacent to Tesla.com. Then, in the following two years, it expanded to React Native and Angular.

Throughout all of these expansions, the website was largely unchanged. For the first three years of the system, it was only updated once or twice annually to link to new migration guides. This was due to the difficulty of updates. The entire website was hand-written in vanilla HTML and did not have any kind of content authoring driving it. It also did not provide code snippets. After awhile, a React Storybook was created, which greatly improved the user experience, but created a second source of truth for users. Many did not know which place they should go to for the latest information.

On top of all of this, the website's IA was a mess (it just had one long scrolling side navigation for all content) and it *did not support search at all*. The design system team answered the same questions daily because users could not self serve in any sort of efficient manner.

### Role

I was the sole designer on this project, partnering with engineering to build the redesigned website. I also interviewed design, engineering, and product stakeholders that consume the system to gather their feedback.

### Deliverables

I redesigned the website from the ground-up to be a best-in-class demo of the system and address the many issues we faced with the original website. I conducted user interviews, held exercises, and more to properly gather user needs and properly scope them out. In preparation for the launch, I also rewrote 50+ documentation pages and created 1500+ net-new assets that worked for light and dark mode.

### Timeline

This project took months. The discovery and design phases were short in comparison (~2 months), but I had to advocate over multiple quarters to get this work prioritized.

## Problems

- Current website was built solely with vanilla HTML, did not provide code snippets for other supported packages
- Very difficult to update content, so the content was stale
- Used Storybook for all React code snippets/demos
- Difficult to get code reproductions or share demos
- Documentation was only relevant for the most recent version - leaving many consumers not on latest out to dry
- Content discoverability issue: lack of search, no prioritized IA, long side nav
- Did not demonstrate some of the features of the system (dark mode, RTL support, etc)

## Goals

- Create single source of truth for all design system documentation
- Enable users to find content quickly and easily
- Allow user to choose their preferred code framework
- Make content as easy to update as possible, for technical and non-technical users
- Support website configuration (dark mode, RTL)  for user to test the system's features

## Audit & Research

With the problems and goals established, it was time to dive into the work! The most important place to start was reworking the information architecture to help users find the content they are looking for as easily as possible.

To start, I gathered an inventory of every single page on the existing website, with each page as a card. From there, I conducted a card sort with over ten users with different  functions: designers, engineers, and product managers. This group represented our larger userbase, and the goal was to determine how they would group these topics to help them find this content easier. It was an open card sort, so users could create their own groups and name them.

This resulted in a similarity matrix that made it very easy to understand how most users thought about these topics and what their mental model for interacting with the website was.

## Proposal

Once the research and testing were over with, it was time to move into the design phase, creating a new proposed design for the website.

### Redesigned Homepage

In tandem with improving discoverability, I redesigned the homepage to direct new and existing users to the content that they needed quickly and efficiently. Existing users would rely heavily on search for repeat visits. For new users, they were directed to a "getting started" onboarding experience specific to their role.

### Improved Discoverability

![Groups of topics](/projects/tds-website/tds-website_03.jpg)

The card sort left us with four primary groups: Foundations, Components, Guidelines, and Resources. These were determined based on the most common responses in the card sort.

These top-level groups would also help us cut down on the side navigation length and make content discovery easier generally.

#### Search

Of course, a documentation website needs search, especially search that can identify aliases and keywords within the docs pages.
My proposal was a global search in the header, triggered on any page with "/", and a search on the homepage as the very first action. This optimized for new and returning users alike. It also features string matching, to help users quickly parse which pages are relevant to their query.

#### Overview Pages

Now the overview pages do a better job of setting user expectations and help the user avoid the "now what is that component called?" trap. This use of visuals as language helps new users find what they are looking for, even if they do not have experience with the system.

### Framework Selection

As the system has grown to support different technologies, centralizing all documentation and code snippets together means that users will want to look at documentation relevant to the framework they work with most. So, we added a the ability to pick their preferred framework in properties.

Overview and component pages will allow changing this locally to reference other documentation on a session basis if needed.

### Version Switcher

Since many of our users are not using the latest version of the system, it is very important to provide them with documentation and code snippets that are relevant to their version. This aids day-to-day development, but also provides a clear path to migrate to newer versions, with version-specific migration guides.

### Preferences

We believed that it was very important to demonstrate the power, flexibility, and elegance of the system with the TDS website. It should show users what a best-in-class experience built with the system should look like. This includes demoing key features like light & dark mode and RTL.

### Playground

Finally, we wanted to make it as easy as possible to spin up demos built using the system and/or reproductions of bugs. To do this, we extended the code playgrounds used to render and demonstrate code snippets all over the website to be a full-fledged in-browser code editor, using the Monaco editor.

This made it dramatically easier to provide support to users, especially when providing system demos and debugging.

## Updated Content

With the new website, I also rewrote 50+ documentation pages and created 1500+ net-new assets that worked for light and dark mode. The documentation previously was written by many different maintainers over the years and it showed. I aligned the team on a single set of content guidelines for the website and we performed a large "sanitization" effort to update all the documentation pages to the new standard. From there, I rewrote over 50 pages from scratch, using a consistent structure that helped users find content quickly and made finding similar content across pages much easier.

![Many, many redesigned assets](/projects/tds-website/tds-website_17.jpg)

For the assets, I redesigned all of them across the entire website to use a style that was more "evergreen", enabling less maintenance to update them regularly as products/standards changed. Instead, they focused users on concepts and fundamentals rather than a design that was 1:1 with an ever-changing product. And of course, they needed to work in dark mode! After over 1500 of these.. I was starting to see double.

## Release

After everything was completed, we launched the redesigned website with an email to all of our consumers.

From there, we began to gather even more user feedback. The reception was unbelievably positive, and we had many more ideas on how to improve the website in the future!
