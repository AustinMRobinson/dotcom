## Context

This was the second step in a design-system-driven initiative I led to align our visual style across all platforms.

Tesla's digital experiences are fractured visually across reporting structures and platforms. This began with the vehicle UI team shipping a redesign to the software with the refreshed Model S and X.

The three organizations at Tesla that work on software are IT Apps (where the design system sits), Energy, and Vehicle. The design system was started in the IT Apps organization and the team still sits in that organization. All efforts to align these groups are grassroots, which is exactly what the focus of this effort involves. 

### Role

I was the sole designer on this project, partnering with design and engineering stakeholders in each of the major organizations to gather their feedback and approval on a solution.

## Problems

- All major platforms at Tesla are misaligned in color usage: web, native, vehicle, kiosk and factory
- Only some of the platforms are using a single source of truth for tokens - creating tech debt & making global updates painful
- The current colors are not exhaustive enough to grow into for key patterns like data visualization

## Solution

I created primitive and semantic color palettes that align the entire Tesla ecosystem to a single set of colors and tokens.

Scalability was key - we needed a palette that was going to work for current and future needs. Because of this, I expanded our set of primitives significantly.

Of course, accessibility was a non-negotiable. All colors in the semantic color palette needed to meet WCAG AA color contrast ratio requirements.

### Primitive Colors

Every time I create large palettes, I rely on connecting the hues and their corresponding scales to the overall brand. Since Tesla uses a primary blue for experiences rather than the brand red, all of the hues were chosen to be harmonious with that blue.

Leveraging bezier curves on the HSB colors (and a lot of tweaking), I created a set of primitive colors that provided us room to grow into over the years.

### Semantic Colors

One of my primary goals with the semantic layer was to keep usage and naming as close to our existing usage as possible, in order to prevent needless breaking changes. I followed our token naming structure and expanded our semantic colors to fit the wide variety of use cases needed across platforms.

The goal here was to create a set that would cover the majority of use cases for each of the platforms, while also providing platform-specific semantic color tokens. Generally, I try not to optimize for any edge cases that would introduce unnecessary inconsistency or wasted effort.

## Accessibility

Throughout the process, I tested the primitive and semantic color palettes, but once they were largely ready, I stress tested them against hundreds of screens. These screens represented a large variety of scenarios including data density, color usage, and platforms.

And, of course, accessibility was at the core of everything that happened. It is extremely important and a non-negotiable. I strove to make sure we met AA color contrast across the board, making sure we were getting at least a 4.5:1 ratio on our worst case scenarios (far right).

## Conclusion & Impact

After many rounds of revision and approval, we landed on a solution that we were happy with!

This effort ended up being a situation where the tail wagged the dog, in which I worked with a few product teams and organization leaders to define a dark mode strategy across all applications in each platform and even across platforms. This was the first effort of its kind at Tesla.

Finally, after literal years since the vehicle UI team shipped their refreshed UI, we had a consistent approach for color, all referencing tokens from the design system as a source of truth.
